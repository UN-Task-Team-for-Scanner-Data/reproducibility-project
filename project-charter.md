# Project Charter

## Project overview

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also done using software availible to researchers in a way that is custom to them and the code and detailed processes are typically not made easily availible as part of the research project. This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges to do this within the discipline. Specifically, it is not easy to find or access open datasets that can be used for research  purposes. Once data is found, the metadata on each dataset will differ, making it challenging to process and use the data, such as for repeatable research processes. Finally, once a resarcher has access to the data, it is not clear how code and processing logic should be shared as part of the research project to make the project reprodubile. In other words, the process is not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR).

# *Raison d'Ãªtre* of the project

The project aims to simplify this situation in the price statistics discipline by tackling the challenges faced. In other words, the project aims to lower the barrier for reproducibility, making it easy for researchers to work openly.
