Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets and don’t publish the code alongside the research so that a specific methodology or finding can be easily reproduced. The idea of this project is to help in both topics! We aim to:\n\nProvide clear and approachable guidance on how researchers in price statistics can make their projects reproducible (including by learning new skills, by understanding how to publish and cite code, and many other topics)\nSupport cataloging open datasets that can be used as benchmarks to use for research purposes. The idea is to have all findings trialed and demonstrated on open benchmark datasets."

The open datasets that exist are not organized or cohesively documented/available.\nThe reason why reproducibility is important is not as inherent/widely communicated as it could be, hence any attempts to solve the technical and processes aspects needs to include this aspect in the communication.\n\nThe group touched on goals to solve these aspects and on processes that can be set up to incentivize reproducibility, including by lowering the complexity and creating an easy ‘on ramp’ to making projects more reproducible (including by cataloging open datasets and showcasing how code can be made reproducible), coordinating with the two bi-annual confernece to recommend reproducibility be part of the paper submission process, embedding metadata standards into the data availbile to make it easier and more standardized when various benchmark datasets are used to evaluate a specific method, etc.\nThe data catalogue for open datasets was seen as a major deliverable to the discipline, and one that needed to be phased. In other words we can set up a ‘proof of concept’ or interim catalogue in a simple way to demonstrate the use case, and later transition to a fuller and more comprehensive catalogue with more resources and infrastructure, potentially hosted by the UN Global Platform.

    "text": "Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also done using software available to researchers in a way that is custom to them and the code and detailed processes are typically not made easily available as part of the research project. This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges to do this within the discipline. Specifically, it is not easy to find or access open datasets that can be used for research purposes. Once data is found, the metadata on each dataset will differ, making it challenging to process and use the data, such as for repeatable research processes. Finally, once a researcher has access to the data, it is not clear how code and processing logic should be shared as part of the research project to make the project reproducible. In other words, the process is not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR).\n\n\n\nThe project aims to simplify this situation in the price statistics discipline by tackling the challenges that researchers face. In other words, the project aims to lower the barrier for reproducibility, making it intuitively easy (with some practice) for researchers to work openly. From an open science point of view, making research more routinely reproducible will help accelerate the pace at which consensus is reached on various topics as results can quickly become replicable and even generalizable.\n\n\n\nAs the project tackles the main challenges facing the discipline, it aims to deliver the following aspects:\n\nObjective A: Developing an interim data catalogue tool for several open datasets and publishing several open datasets as a proof of concept. The idea is to start helping researchers know how to reference open datasets for better replicability within the discipline\n\nA.1. Mock up an interim data catalogue on the UNGP GitLab static site that is easy to read through and understand. The catalogue will be made available on its own GitHub repo.\nA.2. Investigate the applicable metadata for publishing/registering a dataset and outline an ingestion/registration process that can be leveraged to onboard datasets to the interim data catalogue.\nA.3. Coordinate the registering of several open datasets that can act as a pilot for the interim data catalogue.\n\nObjective B: Developing a white paper to outline the why, the what, the where, the when (in the research process) and the how. The idea is to create a high level guide for researchers, and could build on the FAIR or reproducibility literature and apply it to our domain. The paper would have several sub components that should be investigated and discussed, such as:\n\nB.1. Investigate processes around data – such as how to reference the data (internal, public, or synthetic), how to incentivize the use of benchmark datasets for specific tasks in the discipline, how to deal with complex use cases (such as confidentiality or privately owned but widely used data).\nB.2.
