In a technical sense, these are often git repositories (in say GitHub) that include a structure similar to the one in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Exemplar price index pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nA little about each aspect\nA data folder that outlines where to store the raw dataset used for the research project.

The folder is created in order to ensure that when a local copy of the compendium is used by researchers, they know where to put the data to ensure that the code will replicate the results in full.\nTechnically, this means making sure that the .gitignore skips this data file\n\n\nA folder for functions (or other code) that helps process your data into the relevant outputs. This could include the code to clean and prepare the raw dataset for research purposes, the code to create the processing and research experiments, as well as notebooks where the data is explored and various aspects that feed the research paper are generated.\nA folder for the output data. This data can be versioned (if it is not sensitive) with the repository and allows researchers to replicate the process. Note, if the output data can be used for research in its own right, it may be appropriate to register this dataset on a public repository (such as Zenodo) that mints a DOI.\nA folder for documentation to that explain key aspects of the research. This folder stores project documentation or the project design, however code should also be documented well.\nA licence. This will tell users how they can use the code.\nA .gitignore file. There are some files and folders that should not be version controlled. Notable example is datasets\nA file to recreate the environment on which the code will run identically. A shift in one package version to another may change the output, hence its key to track exactly how to replicate the same environment and get the same result.\nFinally, a README to introduce the project.

    "text": "Citing software is historically not something that researchers have done. Code can often be hard to cite and the software used to derive the results of a paper was usually seen as a “detail” that is not worth mentioning in the body of paper. (Perhaps to avoid too many questions about how, exactly, the results in the paper were derived.) The last decade has seen a move towards more reproducible research in economics—mainstream journals require code and usually data for quantitative papers—and the proliferation of open-source research software has made it easier to reliably cite the software used for research.\nCiting code is particularly important in the area of price statistics to facilitate reproducible research. There are a great many price index methods, often with fiddly variations, used by different researchers and it is important to know the exact implementation used to generate a price index in order to reproduce the construction of that index. Research for price statistics is also usually done by government agencies; transparency about the code to generate the results that inform the methods used by government agencies is important to maintain the trust in official statistics.\nFor further reading, the Turing Way provides a good overview for citing code in research and represents the current state of the world of open-source research software."

Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets and don’t publish the code alongside the research so that a specific methodology or finding can be easily reproduced. The idea of this project is to help in both topics! We aim to:\n\nProvide clear and approachable guidance on how researchers in price statistics can make their projects reproducible (including by learning new skills, by understanding how to publish and cite code, and many other topics)\nSupport cataloging open datasets that can be used as benchmarks to use for research purposes. The idea is to have all findings trialed and demonstrated on open benchmark datasets.\n\nThe project also builds on great efforts of early promoters of open science in the discipline!1 We are aiming to continue to build momentum and make it easier for researchers to work openly!"

The group then decided how to tackle this problem and how to properly scope the objectives to make things achievable. Main challenges currently faced in the discipline included:\n\nReserach is becoming increasingly empirical, hence we need processes to work with data and code to make the research more easily reproducible\nThere are no agreed upon benchmark datasets per se in the discipline to test methods on\nThe discipline will not own most of the datasets as most research is done on either confidential internal datasets owned by NSOs or on proprietary (purchased datasets). The open datasets that exist are not organized or cohesively documented/available.\nThe reason why reproducibility is important is not as inherent/widely communicated as it could be, hence any attempts to solve the technical and processes aspects needs to include this aspect in the communication.\n\nThe group touched on goals to solve these aspects and on processes that can be set up to incentivize reproducibility, including by lowering the complexity and creating an easy ‘on ramp’ to making projects more reproducible (including by cataloging open datasets and showcasing how code can be made reproducible), coordinating with the two bi-annual confernece to recommend reproducibility be part of the paper submission process, embedding metadata standards into the data availbile to make it easier and more standardized when various benchmark datasets are used to evaluate a specific method, etc.\nThe data catalogue for open datasets was seen as a major deliverable to the discipline, and one that needed to be phased. In other words we can set up a ‘proof of concept’ or interim catalogue in a simple way to demonstrate the use case, and later transition to a fuller and more comprehensive catalogue with more resources and infrastructure, potentially hosted by the UN Global Platform. Showcasing the interim solution and broadening the adoption to beyond just price statistics would help make this business case.\nThe outcome of the discussion resolved to target two main deliverables: developing the proof of concept data catalogue, and writing guidance (for instance in the form of a white paper) on how to make projects more reproducible. This target scope was later summarized through our project charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro and discussion on timelines and scope. Confirm cadence of meetings\nQuick discussion on how to track PM activity. We could use something like GitHub, the UN wiki, or some other option\nDiscussion on Objective A. We have two options (.Stat suite and data contract catalogue) for interim data catalogue.\nDiscussion on Objective B. Can we adopt any best practices from the Turning Way and their template repo for price statistics?\nRoundtable\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup discussed objectives for the 2025 CPI Expert Group meeting. It was decided to focus on an interim data catalogue and provide interim guidance at the conference, with the fuller guidance to be developed over the next year.\nGitHub projects was agreed upon as the structure for PM activity\nThe draft data catalogue idea was given the green light to flush out further as our likely implementation of the interim version. Metadata strandards should be implemented but it would be hard to use a platform where we don’t own the dataset (such as dominik’s data).\nGuidelines for how to develop reproducible research through git was seen as a good way, with the idea that the guidance we would produce would (a) provide the target state to aim for and (b) summarize maturity levels (similar to RAP maturity levels) that showcase how researchers can start easily and progress over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion on the proposed project charter for the project (since merged into main)\nUpdate on the 2 repositories for the project (project repo and interim data catalogue repo) and the mocked up project management approach\nRoundtable\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam discussed scope for 2025 CPI EG presentation. The project plan outlined two milestones, one on data catalogue and one on guidance will be the target. The project structure and use of the GitHub project was summarized.\nThe use of the two repos was discussed. The reproducibility-project repo will host the guidance we develop in whatever format we decide (ideas shared including using quarto to write reproducible papers, or a quarto static site if we will more tend towards creating guidance). price-stats-data-catalogue will host the interim open data catalogue.\nScope of the data contract was firmed up - we could aim to catalogue input datasets that are used to create some experimental indices and version the output datasets (that may be price indices or other artifacts) as part of the repository on github (such as by saving them in data folder and formatting them in tidy data format).\nUse of tools like Zenodo was discussed and will be investigated to mint DOIs - ticket #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion on format for meeting minutes and how to review/approve the minutes each meeting.\nHow to track materials related to reproducibility but are just references to others’ material (not the overall guidance we will provide).\nWhat format is seen as the best way to deliver guidance on reproducibility? It is best to decide an applicable format and stick with it. Options include writing a paper, using a static site, or using the wiki\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team agreed on keeping notes in this meeting-minutes.md file. The team also agreed to the process:\n\nThe note taker would summarize the meeting and would draft a branch and prepare a Pull Request for the team to review the meeting minutes at the next meeting.\nAt the start of the next meeting, the team would review the PR, would commit any changes/fixes needed. and squash and commit the PR into the main branch to approve the minutes.\n\nThe team agreed to track other materials in other-open-materials.md for now\nThe team discussed the means of how guidance will be provided at the end of the day as a lot of material could be included based on the goals in Objective B of our project. Some possible options:\n\na paper (similar to say the FAIR paper on software to be presented at say 2026 Ottawa Group conference) as the main document for guidance and other materials as supporting (like the catalogue). This could use the quarto manuscript format for example.\na static site (again say a quarto one like this one) as the main means of sharing guidance, but also a short paper for the 2026 OG conference as an offline guide\na set of wiki pages similar to other content made by the Task Team\n\nThe team agreed that a static site (the quarto option) is likely the most appropriate as the site can be expanded and maintained as appropriate, a presentation with a link to the site could be provided at conferences.\nThe team discussed planning for the next 1.5 months. The project roadmap outlines the target timelines. As several issues remain unassigned, the team are encouraged to sign up based on bandwidth.\nRoundtable discussion included:\n\nUpdate on Zenodo - which is an option for uploading and citing data (detail in issue 3). There isn’t a process yet identified for datasets that are not owned by the community and where the owner does not upload it to a repository that mints a DOI.\nUpdate on citing data in PriceIndices R package as it has a DOI.

For instance, how should researchers use data from an R package (such as the PriceIndices package, which has datasets we would like to make list in the interim catalogue) and they wanted to import the data and use it in Python? The team discussed on a phased approach: guidance on how to download the dataset and use it in python from the R ecosystem will be proposed; a longer term approach could be to work with dataset owners to get them to publish it on a repository like Zenodo.\nSupport by the UN Global Platform team for the project was also discussed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview of skeleton data catalogue\nReview of the changes to the project site, specifically how to cite code and how to cite data sections\nReview roadmap and discussion of topics left to finish in this phase of the project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team discussed the skeleton of the proof of concecept data catalogue. The technical process to register new datasets is basically to (1) draft a new yaml file in the datasets/ folder using the datacontrac.cli specifications, and then (2) when the PR is accepted (after releveant review) and merged with the main branch, the runner will rerender the catalogue and the dataset will show up.\nThe team discussed next steps. The dataset in #6 is still the third we’d want for presentation at CPI EG.\nThere is a need to differentiate open versus proprietary but popular datasets.
