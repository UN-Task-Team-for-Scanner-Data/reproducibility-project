Welcome to the project aiming to help researchers in the field of price statistics make their projects more reproducible and to use more open (and FAIR) data in their projects.

# About the project

## What this project aims to do

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as it could be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets and don't publish the code alongside the research so that a specific methodology or finding can be easily reproduced. The idea of this project is to help in both topics! We aim to:

-   Provide clear and approachable guidance on how researchers in price statistics can make their projects reproducible (including by learning new skills, by understanding how to publish and cite code, and many other topics)
-   Support cataloging open datasets that can be used as benchmarks to use for research purposes. The idea is to have all findings trialed and demonstrated on open benchmark datasets.

## What this project does not aim to do

As there is a lot of great guidance on the topic already, including [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines or RAP](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/), and many more resources - the idea is to distilling key information for the price statistics community, not to create a new standard.

# Overview of reproducibility guidance

## Key concepts

The idea is to make it easy for researchers to prioritize using [open data](/docs/datasets-guidance/catalogue.qmd) and publish their [research compendium](/docs/reproducibility-guidance/intro.qmd) (code and related objects) with their research. In either case, other researchers can reproduce the research, expand on it, and apply it to internal data.

Stepping back a bit, let us first define what reproducibility means. While there are many definitions, the aim of reproducible research is to ensure that work can be independently recreated from the same data and the same code. If researchers don't have access to the same data (which may be locked down due to confidentiality reasons), researchers can aim to replicate the result with their own data.

To support open-science within price statistics, the project recommends:

a.  That researchers in the discipline use of open datasets when available in order to support reproducible or robust research. This is why the project has started a [catalogue of open datasets](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/) that can be leveraged for research purposes;
b.  The publication of research code and related research artifacts so that other researchers can independently reproduce all research results. The project provides guidance on structuring and publishing research code so that others can reproduce your results.

Ideally, both aspects are adopted by researchers. However even the adoption of one is valuable as it is possible to replicate the results with different data. Without either, a slower and less effective goal of science in the discipline is generalizable findings by non-reproducible research simply from what is stated in each researchers' paper (the status quo).

## Navigating the guidance

While guidance will expand over time, the following sections and links can help researchers in the discipline:

-   [Catalogue of open datasets available to price statisticians](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/)
-   [Guidance on the open data catalogue and how to register new datasets](/docs/datasets-guidance/catalogue.qmd)
-   [Recommendations on making research code open](/docs/reproducibility-guidance/intro.qmd)
-   [Guidance on how to cite others' code](/docs/reproducibility-guidance/citing-code.qmd) and [how to cite open datasets](/docs/datasets-guidance/how-to-cite.qmd) in your research.
-   [Options for those wanting to publish new datasets in the catalogue](/docs/datasets-guidance/opening-up-datasets.qmd)

We also recommend other guidance related to the topic but not specific to price statistics:

-   [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) is a wonderful and comprehensive guide for open research
-   [The Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (or RAP)](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/) is another very applicable paradigm for reproducibility, although has come to be applied within official statistics as a way to operationalize production processes. Many UN classes are nowadays teaching these principles as a basic minimum standard within official statistics and have been recommended by the ONS for price statistics.[^1][^2]
