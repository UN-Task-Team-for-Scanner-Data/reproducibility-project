## Software for official statistics

There are many open-source software packages for official statistics and survey
statistics. The two best lists are:

- [Awesome list of official statistics software](https://github.com/SNStatComp/awesome-official-statistics-software)

- [CRAN task view for Official Statistics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=OfficialStatistics)

Eurostat also has a similar list that's worth exploring:

- [eurostat@github](https://github.com/eurostat/README?tab=readme-ov-file)

Although some of the packages on these lists are for computing
index numbers (and are enumerated in the next section), there are several
complementary tools for, e.g., sampling that are nonetheless important for price
statistics.

## Software for price statistics

::: {.callout-note title = "This list is a work in progress"}
Please let us know about any software packages for making price indexes that
we missed.
:::

Open source software for price statistics can be split into packages for
computing index numbers and software to facilitate accessible official
statistics. Most software for price statistics is implemented in R, with the
remainder in Python. Note that this list is for software _packages_ related to
price statistics that are broadly available on, e.g., CRAN tor PyPI, not data
analysis _scripts_ used to derive a price index.
