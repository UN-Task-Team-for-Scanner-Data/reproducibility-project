## Software for official statistics

There are many open-source software packages for official statistics and
survey statistics. The two best lists of these packages are:

-   [Awesome list of official statistics
    software](https://github.com/SNStatComp/awesome-official-statistics-software)
-   [CRAN task view for Official
    Statistics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=OfficialStatistics)

Eurostat also has a similar list that's worth exploring:

-   [eurostat\@github](https://github.com/eurostat/README?tab=readme-ov-file)

Although some of the packages on these lists are for computing index
numbers (and are enumerated in the next section), there are several
complementary tools for, e.g., sampling, seasonal adjustment, that are
nonetheless important for price statistics.

The [UNECE High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official
Statistics](https://unece.github.io/OSS/) gives a good overview of the
role of open-source software in the production official statistics, and
can help contextualize the software on these lists.

## Software for price statistics

::: {.callout-note title = "This list is a work in progress"}
Please let us know about any software packages relevant for price statistics
that we missed.
:::

Most software for price statistics is implemented in R, with the
remainder in Python. The projects
listed here may differ in various aspects, such as maturity level,
maintenance status, licensing terms, and more. Users are encouraged to
assess whether each open-source tool aligns with their specific
requirements. Note that this list is for software *packages*
related to price statistics that are broadly available on, e.g., CRAN or
PyPI, not data analysis *scripts* used to derive a price index. Packages
enable efficient code reuse across multiple projects and are more likely to
be useful to the broader community. 

Open-source software packages for price statistics are split into those for
computing index numbers and those to facilitate accessible official
statistics. There are also several software papers related to price statistics.

## Reproducibility resources

There are several good resources for how to make data analysis and
research projects reproducible. These are not about price statistics
*per se*, but the ideas and tools are broadly applicable to the field.
The [example of a price-index
pipeline](https://github.com/UN-Task-Team-for-Scanner-Data/price-index-pipeline)
shows how these ideas around reproducibility can pair with the software
listed above.
