Citing software is historically not something that researchers have done. Code can
often be hard to cite and the software used to derive the results of a paper was
usually seen as a "detail" that is not worth mentioning in the body of paper. 
(Perhaps to avoid too many questions about how, exactly, the results in the
paper were derived.) The last decade has seen a move towards more reproducible
research in economics---mainstream journals require code and usually data for
quantitative papers---and the proliferation of open-source research software
has made it easier to reliably cite the software used for research.

Citing code is particularly important in the area of price statistics to
facilitate reproducible research. There are a great many price index methods,
often with fiddly variations, used by different researchers and it is important to know the exact
implementation used to generate a price index in order to reproduce the
construction of that index. Research for price statistics is also
usually done by government agencies; transparency about the code to generate the results that inform
the methods used by government agencies is important to maintain the trust in
official statistics.

For further reading, the [Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable) provides
a good overview for citing code in research and represents the current state of
the world of open-source research software.

## Citing research software

Unlike academic papers, there is no one way to cite a piece of software. How to
cite a piece of software usually depends on how easy the author makes it. For
example, R packages are easy to cite within R using the `citation()` function.

```
install.packages("IndexNumR")
citation("IndexNumR")
```

Modern R packages tend to have their own [website with this information on
display](https://marberts.github.io/piar/authors.html#citation)
and all [CRAN packages get a DOI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PriceIndices/index.html)
to facilitate referencing the use of R packages. Things are less standardized in
the Python ecosystem, but the same ideas apply to make projects citeable
(e.g., [pandas](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3509134)).

Another way to cite a piece of research software is to the cite the paper
introducing this software, usually in a journal like the [Journal of Open Source
Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), the [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index),
or the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/).

```
@article{RJ-2021-038,
  author = {Saavedra-Nieves, Alejandro and Saavedra-Nieves, Paula},
  title = {IndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes},
  journal = {The R Journal},
  year = {2021},
  note = {https://rjournal.github.io/},
  volume = {13},
  issue = {1},
  issn = {2073-4859},
  pages = {253-275}
}
```

Finally, for code that is not in a mainstream repository like CRAN, or does not
have a website with citation information, [citation information can sometimes be
found in the source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marberts/piar/refs/heads/main/CITATION.cff).
Github helps to find the citation information for a 
package and displays a button to cite the repository.

## Making software citable

Given the variety of ways to cite research software, the key to making it
citeable is making it easy to generate a reference for that software. For R
packages this happens automatically if the package is available on CRAN; for
Python packages (and R packages not on CRAN), a service like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) can be used
to get a DOI to facilitate referencing the software. Although consumers of
software tend not to get it directly from a source-code
repository, citation metadata can be added to github repositories to make them
more citeable.

## Example

The {piar} R package is an example of a piece of software for making price indexes
that is highly citeable.

```
citation("piar")
```

This information is displayed on the [project website](https://marberts.github.io/piar/authors.html#citation)
and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/piar/citation.html).
The citation information is contained in the source code, and consequently displayed
by github, and the readme for the project is adorned with badges giving citation
information. The goal is to have citation information available at each entry
point at which a prospective user may first engage with {piar} and to have it
be easy to add to a reference list.
