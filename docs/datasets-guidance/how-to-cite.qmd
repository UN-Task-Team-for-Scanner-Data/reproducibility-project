Citing an open dataset for a research project is straightforward if it is
archived in an open research repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). In
this case it will have the relevant metadata, along with a DOI, to make it
easily citeable, even if access to these data is restricted. Unfortunately open
datasets do not always reside in a repository like Zenodo.
A common place for open datasets in statistics, and in particular price
statistics, is as part of an R package on CRAN. Citing these datasets is not
difficult---all CRAN packages have a DOI and are easily cited---but, as part of
a package, data are more difficult to access.

## Example: {PriceIndices}

The {PriceIndices} R package comes with several datasets that can be useful for
comparing different index-number methods. Citing these data is easy because R
packages are highly citeable.

```
@Manual{,
  title = {PriceIndices: Calculating Bilateral and Multilateral Price Indexes},
  author = {Jacek Bia≈Çek},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.32614/CRAN.package.PriceIndices},
  url = {https://cran.r-project.org/package=PriceIndices},
  note = {R package version 0.2.3}
}
```

Using these data is easy enough with R. Simply install the package and the
datasets become available from within R.

```{r}
# install.packages("PriceIndices")
head(PriceIndices::coffee)
```

Using these datasets is less convenient with, say, Python. One option is to simply
export them in an interoperable format like Apache Parquet from R.

```{r}
arrow::write_parquet(PriceIndices::coffee, "coffee.parquet")
```

Now it is simple to use these data with Python.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

pd.read_parquet("coffee.parquet").head()
```

Another approach, and one that doesn't use R, is to simply download the {PriceIndices}
package from CRAN and use the [{rdata}](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07540) Python
package to read the datasets in Python.

```{bash}
curl -s https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz -o PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz
tar -vxzf PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz PriceIndices/data
```

```{python}
import rdata
import pandas as pd


def date_constructor(obj, attr):
    return pd.to_datetime(obj, unit="D")

constructor_dict = {**rdata.conversion.DEFAULT_CLASS_MAP,
                    "Date": date_constructor}

coffee = rdata.read_rda("PriceIndices/data/coffee.rda",
                        constructor_dict=constructor_dict)

pd.DataFrame(coffee["coffee"]).head()
```
