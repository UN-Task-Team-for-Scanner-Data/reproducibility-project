There are two key challenges in the price statistics discipline when it comes to using open data. On the one hand, there are few open data available as most datasets of sufficient size and quality are proprietary. On the other hand, it is hard to find out what datasets do exist as there is not discipline specific listing. As most researchers are employed at organizations (such as National Statistical Organizations or NSOs) naturally have access to internal datasets and often are under pressure to answer questions relating them, it is only natural to default to proprietary over datasets. To help alleviate this, the project has developed a basic discipline specific data catalogue.

## [Price Statistics Open Data Catalogue](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/index.html)

The idea of this data catalogue is to list open datasets available and often used within price statistics discipline. It describes each dataset in a structured and detailed manner, allowing researchers to search for a dataset that may fit their needs, understand the options, navigate to the site of the data provider that hosts that dataset, and then use it for their research.

### What the catalogue does

The purpose of the catalogue is to be a very simple listing of open datasets applicable for research purposes. It is searchable according to standard data types (such as scanner data), and describes the metadata necessary for researchers to understand and select the dataset most applicable to them.

### What the catalogue does not do

The catalogue does not store the dataset itself but simply describes it in detail. The catalogue does provide a simple interface to common researcher questions, such as how to cite the dataset, limitations to its use, etc.

## This is an interim catalogue only!

This will very likely not be the long-term stable data catalogue the discpline. The idea however it to start with this interim (and very simple open-source) catalogue, while the project investigates a more viable longer term solution.
