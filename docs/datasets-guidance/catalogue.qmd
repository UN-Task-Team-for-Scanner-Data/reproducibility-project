Researchers looking to leverage open data often struggle to find the right datasets to conduct their analysis and thus naturally adopt datasets that are (often) made available by their organization. Furthemore, if working with open data is hard, this disincentives the dissemination of new open datasets, further reinforcing the negative feedback loop!

To help alleviate this, the project has developed a basic discipline specific data catalogue!

## [Price Statistics Open Data Catalogue](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/index.html)

The idea is simple. The catalogue simply lists open datasets of high value to the discipline, and describes each in a standardized way! Figure 1 (below) visually explains how the process works.

### What the catalogue does

The purpose of the catalogue is to be a very simple listing of open datasets applicable for research purposes. It is searchable according to standard data types (such as scanner data), and describes the metadata necessary for researchers to understand and select the dataset most applicable to them.

### What the catalogue does not do

The catalogue does not store the dataset itself but simply describes it in detail. The catalogue does provide a simple interface to common researcher questions, such as how to cite the dataset, limitations to its use, etc.

## This is an interim catalogue only!

This will very likely not be the long-term stable data catalogue the discpline. The idea however it to start with this interim (and very simple open-source) catalogue, while the project investigates a more viable longer term solution.
