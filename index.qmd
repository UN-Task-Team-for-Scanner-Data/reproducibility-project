Welcome to the project aiming to help researchers in the field of price statistics make their projects more reproducible and to use more open (and FAIR) data in their projects. This project is led by Workstream 5 of the [UN Task Team on Scanner data](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/task-teams/scanner/index.cshtml), part of the [UN Committee of Experts on Big Data and Data Science for Official Statistics (UN-CEBD)](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/index.cshtml).

# Raison d'Ãªtre of the project

## What this project aims to do

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as it could be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets and don't publish the code alongside the research so that a specific methodology or finding can be easily reproduced. The idea of this project is to help in both topics! We aim to:

-   Provide clear and approachable guidance on how researchers in price statistics can make their projects reproducible (including by learning new skills, by understanding how to publish and cite code, and many other topics)
-   Support cataloging open datasets that can be used as benchmarks to use for research purposes. The idea is to have all findings trialed and demonstrated on open benchmark datasets.

## What this project does not aim to do

As there is a lot of great guidance on the topic already, including [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines or RAP](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/), and many more resources - the idea is to distilling key information for the price statistics community, not to create a new standard.
