# Project Charter

## Project overview

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also done using software available to researchers in a way that is custom to them and the code and detailed processes are typically not made easily available as part of the research project. This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges to do this within the discipline. Specifically, it is not easy to find or access open datasets that can be used for research purposes. Once data is found, the metadata on each dataset will differ, making it challenging to process and use the data, such as for repeatable research processes. Finally, once a researcher has access to the data, it is not clear how code and processing logic should be shared as part of the research project to make the project reproducible. In other words, the process is not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR).

## *Raison d'être* of the project

The project aims to simplify this situation in the price statistics discipline by tackling the challenges that researchers face. In other words, the project aims to lower the barrier for reproducibility, making it intuitively easy (with some practice) for researchers to work openly. From an open science point of view, making research more routinely reproducible will help accelerate the pace at which consensus is reached on various topics as [results can quickly become replicable and even generalizable](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions).

## Objectives and results in a little more detail

As the project tackles the main challenges facing the discipline, it looks to deliver on a few objectives. The project adopts [the OKR framework](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example) to structure key results around aimed for objectives.

-   **Objective A:** Catalogue all applicable datasets that researchers could leverage for research purposes, whether they are open or proprietary but highly applicable.

    -   Mock up an interim data catalogue that is easy to read through and understand.
    -   Investigate the applicable metadata for publishing/registering a dataset and outline an ingestion/registration process that can be leveraged to onboard datasets to the interim data catalogue.
    -   Coordinate the registering of several open datasets that can act as a pilot for the interim data catalogue.

-   **Objective B**: Develop guidance on reproducibility to outline the why, the what, the where, the when (in the research process) and the how to apply best practices to make the discipline open and FAIR.

    -   Investigate processes around data – such as how to reference the data (internal, public, or synthetic), how to incentivize the use of benchmark datasets for specific tasks in the discipline, how to deal with complex use cases (such as confidentiality or privately owned but widely used data).
    -   Investigate processes around code and related objects like clear code documentation – such as where to publish code, what should be included in the repository, how to clearly document the process, etc. If applicable, make template repositories or examples available for the community.
    -   Outlining of the white paper/guidance for the discipline on reproducibility

-   **Object C**: Integrate reproducibility guidelines within administrative processes of the discipline to drive adoption

    -   Work with Ottawa Group organizers to integrate reproducibility guidelines into the conference process
