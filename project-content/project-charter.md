# Project Charter

## Project overview

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also usually done with proprietary software and is not shared with the research output. The result is that it is challenging to reproduce or replicate trialed methods, as well as to extend and teach (oneself or others) the methods in question.

This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges within the discipline making adoption of good practices hard. For instance, it is not easy to find, access, or understand open datasets so that they can be used for research purposes. There is also a lack of discipline-specific guidance on how [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR) principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) can be applied to projects to make them reproducible.

## *Raison d'Ãªtre /* vision for the project

The project aims to instill reproducibility within the discipline by lowering barriers and simplifying processes for adoption of good practices. This overarching goal is aligned with the [Principles of Official Statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/hb/E-fundamental%20principles_A4-WEB.pdf), specifically the strengthening of professional standards, scientific principles, and professional ethics.

# Objectives of the project

Following the [OKR approach](https://www.whatmatters.com/okrs-explained), a target is set each year to reach this overall vision.

## Overall objective for the year between May 2025 and late April 2026

| Objective: | Instill foundational reproducibility principles in methodological and teaching material shared within the discipline, as measured by |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key Result 1: | Development of foundational guidance on reproducibility to ensure all critical use cases are covered. |
| Key Result 2 | Cataloguing of 10 diverse and open datasets to support research with various methods |
| Key Result 3 | Reproducibility in Ottawa Group proceedings up by at least N% |

: 2025-26 OKRs

Each KR has an issue that focuses on how to measure it.

# Project management structure

The project adopts [the OKR framework](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example) to structure key results that help deliver each objective. To pace the project, an annual cycle is used to fit into a several year horizon and report back to the discipline at our annual conferences (the Ottawa Group and the Group of Experts on the CPI). As such:

-   Each year a GitHub milestone is structured to track the initiatives (i.e. issues) that help move the needle on a specific KR.
-   Labels are used to categorize the various Key Results around the FAIR principles.
